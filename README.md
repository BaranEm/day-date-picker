How to setup
--------------
- 1: Create picker

	`picker = [[DayDatePickerView alloc]initWithFrame:frame];`
- 2: Set delegate and data source (optional)

	`picker.delegate = self;`
	`picker.dataSource = self`

- 4: Set date and minimum date (optional)
	`picker.date = [NSDate date];`
	`picker.minimumDate = [NSDate date];`

Delegate and Data Source
--------------
DayDatePickerView is almost entirely customizable, making is an ideal replacement for UIDatePicker if working with dates only
You can:

- Change the selection indicator: change opacity, background color or even the whole view itself
- Change the way columns are displayed: width and background color
- Change the way rows are displayed: foreground color, disabled color, background color and font
- Change the UIDateFormatters (day, month and year) to suit your liking
- Recieve updates when the date is changed
